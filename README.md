# console_based_budget_tracker

The following features are included in this implementation:

1. Expense and Income Entry: Users are able to enter their income and expenses along with quantities and categories.
   
2. Budget Calculation: This computes what's left over after taking revenue and spending into account.
   
3. Expense Analysis: Classifies expenses and shows spending patterns to offer insights.
   
4. Data Persistence: A JSON file called transactions contains the transactions.JSON for long-term tracking.

You can use the same procedures as in the previous response to run this Python script locally on your PC. When asked, be sure to enter the correct income and expense amounts, categories, and dates.
